The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static HTML and CSS website generator. Many of the old blog posts were exported from an ancient wordpress site.

## Getting Started

1. [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing#chocolatey-windows): `choco install hugo -confirm`
1. Run the site locally: `hugo server`
1. Create a new post: `hugo new posts/post-title.md`

Posts are actually Markdown files. A `*.md` reference can be found at [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/hugo/).
