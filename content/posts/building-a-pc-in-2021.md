title: Building a PC (during a global chip shortage)

The global chip shortage was such a big deal it has its own [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_global_chip_shortage). Me (and apparently the entire world) wanted to have the latest tech to use while being locked up at home.

## If you can't beat 'em, join 'em

Basically, finding one of the latest GPUs or CPUs was almost impossible. Scalpers and bots have made online shopping a nightmare but I was determined to find them at MSRP.

Thankfully, there are some bots out there that check stock and report back in places such as twitter, telegram, or discord. I had success using the discord ones such as [pcbuildhelper.com](https://discord.gg/yUAk993) and [StockDrops](https://discord.com/invite/stockdrops) and turning on notifications.

## Tips for grabbing the parts

The easiest places seemed to be the ones with the best bot protection (Best Buy) or ones that forced people to do local pickups (Walmart).

- Best Buy seems to do their drops every morning, 2 weeks apart on a Tuesday.
- Amazon.com's in-stock APIs seem to be ahead of their website. If you see a notification, click the buy now button and it will say purchase failed. You can refresh this page and grab it as soon as the actual stock goes live.
- If you are looking for consoles, good luck. Sony has bot protected direct sales every so often with a queue.

After way too many hours of effort, I was able to acquire (at MSRP) a RTX 3080 FE and an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X CPU (pictured below):

## The Build

My final parts list [can be found on pcpartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/avianbc/saved/#view=JQNN6h). My goal was: a PC that can run the latest games at 1440p 144hz on max settings while still having a hefty amount of RAM for when I am doing some memory intensive database work.

Oddities include having to flash the latest BIOS into my motherboard without a CPU even installed into it. My CPU was so cutting edge that it didnt ship with support built in:

## Final thoughts

Walmart.com now thinks I am a robot due to pressing F5 so many times on their website. Now, when I shop online there I get constant captchas.

A pic of the (almost) final result. Not pictured:

- Improved cable management
- Turned off red lights in motherboard BIOS
- Installed software and made the RAM white to match the GEFORCE RTX logo
