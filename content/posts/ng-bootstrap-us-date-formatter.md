If you have used Angular and Bootstrap then you are probably familar with [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/).

The default formatter that the datepicker uses is the ISO8601 format (yyyy-mm-dd). The docs have a sample that show you how to format the date as dd/mm/yyyy. I have adapted that sample to use the format that is the most widely used in the US (mm/dd/yyyy). Hope you find it useful!
