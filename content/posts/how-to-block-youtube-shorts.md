I've always preferred long-form content. YouTube Shorts, TikToks, and Reels feel like junk food to me—quick dopamine hits that leave me unsatisfied and craving more. They disrupt my focus and make it harder to engage with meaningful videos. Here are some methods I've found to block YouTube Shorts entirely.

## uBlock Origin with the [ublock-hide-yt-shorts filter list](https://github.com/gijsdev/ublock-hide-yt-shorts)

1. Install [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) for your browser (available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
2. Open the uBlock Origin dashboard by clicking the uBlock icon in your browser toolbar and selecting the gear icon.
3. Navigate to the "Filter lists" tab.
4. Scroll down to the "Custom" section and click on "Import..."
5. Paste the following URL into the text box: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gijsdev/ublock-hide-yt-shorts/master/list.txt`
6. Click "Apply changes" at the top of the dashboard.

## Using a Browser Extension
