### Programming Related Podcasts

<img class=" alignright" title="" src="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/images/tdl_logo1.png" alt="" height="60" /> 

  * [This Developer’s Life](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/) – Podcast in the style of This American Life dealing with programming related topics. An all time favorite of mine.
  * [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) – Scott Hanselman talks about web development, usually dealing with C#, javascript, ASP.NET, and other MS technologies.
  * [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/) – K Scott Allen, John Galloway, and others talk about programming topics.
  * [Programming Throwdown](http://www.programmingthrowdown.com/) – The hosts pick a random technology and give you a broad overview of it followed by its advantages and disadvantages.
  * [Floating Point](http://floatingpoint.cc/) – News, tech, programming, random topics are discussed.
  * [Javascript Jabber](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/) – The JavaScript frameworks that are released approximately 20 minutes are discussed here.
  * [Developer Tea](https://developertea.com/) – Podcast covering a diverse amount of topics relating to being a developer.
  * [Iterate](http://www.imore.com/iterate) – UX, design, and related ideas are discussed in this podcast.
  * [Debug](http://www.imore.com/debug) – Mobile development is discussed in depth, mostly on iPlatforms.

### Hall of Fame – My favorite non-programming podcasts

  * [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/) – The best podcast ever? Short, well produced episodes dealing with design.
  * [TED Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/) – TED Talks are a must.
  * [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/) – The best production of any podcast ever made. Interesting and seemingly random discussions.
  * [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/) – I think this has been cited as the most popular podcast ever until [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/) came along… which was also created by them.
  * [Reply All](http://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/) – Random things relating to the internet are discussed. Gimlet Media is worth paying attention to as every podcast they release is solid gold.
  * [Startup](http://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/) – A podcast documenting company creation from brainstorming, soliciting investors, creating a startup, running it, and more. Interesting look at something not normally public.
  * [Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/radio/) – Economists can be interesting too.
  * [You Are Not So Smart](http://youarenotsosmart.com/) – Self delusion… and cookies?
