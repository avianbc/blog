NGif is a C# .NET library to handle encoding and decoding of animated GIFs. I found a use for it, but it had a few bugs. The very last two pixels were being rendered incorrectly as red and the transparency was not functioning properly. I have fixed these bugs, made a few minor improvements, and included writing to a Stream instead of to a File.
