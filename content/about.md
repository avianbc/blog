## Background

I'm proud to hold a **B.S. in Computer Science** from [Marshall University](http://marshall.edu), where I also minored in **Mathematics** and maintained a 4.0 in-major GPA.

Here's a brief overview of my career journey:

- During college, I was selected for the [WV Governor’s Internship Program](https://intern.wv.gov/), where I had the opportunity to collaborate with developers at the WV State Tax Department.
- I played a key role in modernizing an online filing web app that generated $107 million in tax revenue in a single year.

- Since then, I've been working remotely, focusing on modernizing legacy enterprise SaaS web applications using modern technologies.
- I've re-architected and re-written many legacy SaaS applications, including real-time insurance rating web apps, agency management systems (AMS), and a CRM.

## Leisure

When I'm not working, I enjoy:

- **Traveling**: Working remotely gives me the freedom to travel and explore new places.
- **Fitness**: As a [competitive powerlifter](https://symmetricstrength.com/lifter/avian), I prioritize healthy habits to balance out the time I spend in front of a screen. I've recently also dipped my toes into olympic weightlifting and long distance running.
- **Playing guitar**: I'm passionate about all things music-related and own 7 guitars. In 2023 alone, I spent over 1,110 hours (46 days and 6 hours) listening to music!
- **Contributing**: I actively share my knowledge and continue to learn on platforms like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/636942/brad-c) and [/r/learnprogramming](http://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming).
