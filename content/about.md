Here's a brief overview of my career journey:

- During college, I was selected for the [WV Governorâ€™s Internship Program](https://intern.wv.gov/), where I had the opportunity to collaborate with developers at the WV State Tax Department.
- I played a key role in modernizing an online filing web app that generated $107 million in tax revenue in a single year.

- Since then, I've been working remotely, focusing on modernizing legacy enterprise SaaS web applications using modern technologies.
- I've re-architected and re-written many legacy SaaS applications, including real-time insurance rating web apps, agency management systems (AMS), and a CRM.
