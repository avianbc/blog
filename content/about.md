## Background

I hold a **B.S. in Computer Science** from [Marshall University](http://marshall.edu), alongside a minor in **Mathematics** and a 4.0 in-major GPA.

During college, I was selected for the [WV Governorâ€™s Internship Program](http://www.wv.gov/gip), collaborating with WV State Tax Department developers. I later modernized an online filing web app that generated $107 million in tax revenue in a single year.

Post-internship, I joined a B2B software contracting company, crafting numerous web, mobile, and desktop apps across diverse languages and frameworks.

Since 2014, I've been working remotely, specializing in modernizing legacy enterprise SaaS web applications using modern technologies.

## Leisure

Balancing my remote work life, I embrace freedom through travel.

As a [competitive powerlifter](https://symmetricstrength.com/lifter/avian), I prioritize healthy habits to counter screen time.

I'm a guitar enthusiast, passionate about all things music related. Being an audiophile, I racked up 41 days and 7 hours of music listening in 2020 alone.

I actively contribute on Stack Overflow and [/r/learnprogramming](http://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming), sharing knowledge while continuously learning.
