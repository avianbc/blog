## Background

<img class="alignleft" src="/images/2015/01/Marshallo-Logo-Transparent.jpg" alt="Marshall University" />

I graduated from [Marshall University](http://marshall.edu) with a **B.S. in Computer Science**, minor in **Mathematics**, and a 4.0 in-major GPA.

During college, I participated in the [WV Governorâ€™s Internship Program](http://www.wv.gov/gip) at the WV State Tax Department. Subsequently, I developed an online filing web app that generated $107 million in tax revenue in 2013.

Post-internship, I joined a B2B software contracting company, building numerous web, mobile, and desktop apps across different languages and frameworks.

Since 2014, I have been working 100% remote modernizing legacy (ColdFusion, MS SilverLight, ASP.NET WebForms) enterprise SaaS web applications with a specialization in Angular, JavaScript, C#, .NET, and SQL.

## Leisure

Balancing my remote work life, I embrace freedom through travel. I'm also a competitive [powerlifter](https://symmetricstrength.com/lifter/avian) and a proponent of healthy habits to counter screen time.

I'm a guitar enthusiast, passionate about playing and teaching. Sharing more of my music online is on my list!

Being an audiophile, I racked up 41 days and 7 hours of music listening in 2020 alone.

I'm an active contributor on Stack Overflow and [/r/learnprogramming](http://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming), sharing knowledge and learning in return.
