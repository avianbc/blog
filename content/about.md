My name is Brad and I love learning new things.

I am an engineer, hacker, and traveler currently working out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%E2%80%93Ashland_metropolitan_area">OH-WV-KY metro area</a>.

## What I Do

I am a **Lead Full Stack Developer** who has both contributed to and led development on a diverse set of software projects in domains such as:

* Insurance (Health, Auto, Homeowners, and many more)
* Healthcare
* Human Resources
* Law
* Public Utilities
* Commerce
* Education

...and for clients such as:

<img class="alignleft" src="/images/js.png" alt="JavaScript" />

* **Back-end / Desktop / Mobile** – C#, Python
* **Front-end** – JavaScript / TypeScript, Angular, React
* **Databases** – SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
* **Cloud / DevOps** – AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes
* **Leftovers** – Powershell, Git

As a Lead Full Stack Developer I have often had to step outside of my typical comfort zone and completed or contributed to projects in _many_ other languages and frameworks. Quickly learning and applying new things is my specialty.

I’ve also performed DevOps tasks such as setting up automated build servers, continuous integration / deployment pipelines, and migrated some in-house hosted web apps to the cloud.

## Background

<img class="alignleft" src="/images/2015/01/Marshallo-Logo-Transparent.jpg" alt="Marshall University" /> I graduated from [Marshall University](http://marshall.edu) with a **B.S. in Computer Science** and a minor in **Mathematics** as well as a 4.0 in-major GPA.

While at college, I was accepted into the [WV Governor’s Internship Program](http://www.wv.gov/gip) to work with the developers at the WV State Tax Department.

Upon the conclusion of my internship, I was contracted to single-handedly develop an online filing web application that tobacco wholesalers have used to collect $107 million in tax dollars in the year 2013 alone.

Once my contract with the state was done, I jumped on board a software contracting company and built dozens of web, mobile, and desktop apps using all sorts of languages and frameworks.

I am currently working 100% remotely full time with a geographically-sparse team on a SaaS web app that is widely adopted within the insurance industry.

## Leisure

<img class="img-rounded alignleft" src="/images/zipline.jpg" alt="Brad" />

Since I work as a 100% remote developer I use my location independence to my advantage and have been exercising my freedom to travel.

I [powerlift in my home gym](https://symmetricstrength.com/lifter/avian) and eat healthy to counteract the hours spent staring at screens.

I play and teach guitar. I definitely need to record more of it so I can share it online!

I am an audiophile who listens to way too much music. In the year 2020 alone my total listening time clocked in at 41 days, 7 hours.

I hang out on Stack Overflow and [/r/learnprogramming](http://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming) to share my knowledge while learning more along the way.
